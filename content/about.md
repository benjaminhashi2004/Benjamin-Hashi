I'm an Engineer working on Service Meshes, Deep Learning on Edge and Neuro-Memristive Systems.

I work at [Layer5](https://layer5.io/), where we build Open-Source products to make Service Meshes available to everyone.

I’m a maintainer at [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) for the projects - Meshery and Service Mesh Performance.

I also maintain (also the creator) [NSFW Filter](https://github.com/nsfw-filter/nsfw-filter) which is a free and Open-Source web extension.

I'm also pursuing my Master's Degree in Computer Science with a primary focus on Machine Intelligence.

I'm a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6432043061215232) and an [LFX (Community Bridge)](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/mentor/bc364b11-a4ab-4b18-b81e-e071bbcfb40c) Mentor for Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
